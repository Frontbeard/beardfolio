# Beardfolio - My Personal Portfolio 

![mockup](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb2fdbd2-d7dd-4d04-9afe-163187e6cf34)

After spending so much time programming, tweaking existing code, and creating new components, I realized something essential: **I never had a personal portfolio!**  

In this short but enriching journey as a developer, I discovered that a portfolio is not just a tool to showcase your work, but also a way to reflect who you are and what you're passionate about. That's how **"Beardfolio"** was born‚Äîdesigned to combine functionality, design, and my personal style.
